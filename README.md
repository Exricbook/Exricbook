## Hi there 👋

<pre>
I’m a crazy maker who solves problems and occasionally creates some.

The context, the origin, or the nature of those problems are orthogonal to the approaches I take in solving them.

I’m simplistic, pragmatic, and (mostly) to the point 🙃.

🏡 You can find more about me at volkan.io.

Zero To Hero
I have moved most of my repositories from my personal GitHub to Zero to Hero GitHub Organization.

If you want to see a sample of my source code and contributions, Zero to Hero GitHub Organization could be a good place to start.

Thanks
That’s about it.

Never stop asking, always be learning… And may the source be with you 🖖.
